### `Session<State>`

*Extends from [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)*.

A `Session` represents an open connection between the server and the client.

It emits the `connected` event after it has connected and sent the response head to the client.<br />
It emits the `disconnected` event after the connection has been closed.

When using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), the session is considered connected only once the `ReadableStream` contained in the body of the `Response` returned by `getResponse` has began being [consumed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Using_readable_streams).

When using the [Node HTTP APIs](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), the session will send the response status code, headers and other preamble data ahead of time, allowing the session to connect and start pushing events [immediately](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#setimmediatecallback-args). As such, keep in mind that attempting to write additional headers after the session has been created will result in an error being thrown.

#### `new Session<State = DefaultSessionState>(req: IncomingMessage | Http2ServerRequest | Request, res?: ServerResponse | Http2ServerResponse | Response | SessionOptions[, options: SessionOptions])`

*Overloads:*

```typescript
new Session(IncomingMessage, ServerResponse, SessionOptions?)
new Session(Http2ServerRequest, Http2ServerResponse, SessionOptions?)
new Session(Request, Response, SessionOptions?)
new Session(Request, SessionOptions?)
```

`req` is an instance of [`IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), [`Http2ServerRequest`](https://nodejs.org/api/http2.html#class-http2http2serverrequest), [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) or a custom [`Connection`](#connection).

`res` is an instance of [`ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), [`Http2ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/api/http2.html#class-http2http2serverresponse) or [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response), respectively.

`options` is a `SessionOptions` object with the following properties:

|Property|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`serializer`|`function`|`JSON.stringify`|Serialize data to a string that can be written over the wire.<br /><br />Note that only values written with [`push`](#sessionpush-data-unknown-eventname-string-eventid-string--this) are serialized, as everything else is assumed to already be a string.|
|`sanitizer`|`function`||Sanitize values so as to not prematurely dispatch events when writing fields whose text inadvertently contains newlines.<br /><br />By default, CR, LF and CRLF characters are replaced with a single LF character (`\n`) and then any trailing LF characters are stripped.|
|`trustClientEventId`|`boolean`|`true`|Whether to trust or ignore the last event ID given by the client in the `Last-Event-ID` request header.<br /><br />When set to `false`, the `lastId` property will always be initialized to an empty string.|
|`retry`|`number` \| `null`|`2000`|Time in milliseconds for the client to wait before attempting to reconnect if the connection is closed.<br /><br />Give as `null` to avoid sending an explicit reconnection time and allow the client browser to decide itself.|
|`keepAlive`|`number` \| `null`|`10000`|Time in milliseconds interval for the session to send a comment to keep the connection alive.<br /><br />Give as `null` to disable the keep-alive mechanism.|
|`statusCode`|`number`|`200`|<StatusCodeDescription /><br />Ignored if passing a custom [`Connection`](#connection) instance to the `Session` constructor.|
|`headers`|`object`|`{}`|<HeadersDescription /><br />Ignored if passing a custom [`Connection`](#connection) instance to the `Session` constructor|
|`state`|`State`|`DefaultSessionState`|Initial custom state for the session.<br /><br />Accessed via the [`state`](#sessionstate-state) property.<br /><br />When using TypeScript, providing the initial state structure allows the type of the `state` property to be automatically inferred.|

#### `Session#lastId`: `string`

The last event ID sent to the client.

This is initialized to the last event ID given by the user (in the `Last-Event-ID` header) and otherwise is equal to the last ID given to or generated by the [`push`](#sessionpush-data-unknown-eventname-string-eventid-string--this) method.

For security reasons, keep in mind that the client can provide *any* initial ID here. Use the `trustClientEventId` constructor option to ignore the client-given initial ID.

#### `Session#isConnected`: `boolean`

Indicates whether the session and underlying connection is open or not.

#### `Session#state`: `State`

Custom state for this session.

Use this object to safely store information related to the session and user.

You may set an initial value for this property using the `state` property in the [constructor `options` object](#new-sessionstate--defaultsessionstatereq-incomingmessage--http2serverrequest-res-serverresponse--http2serverresponse-options-), allowing its type to be automatically inferred.

Use [module augmentation and declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation) to safely add new properties to the `DefaultSessionState` interface.

#### `Session#getRequest`: `() => Request`

Get a [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object representing the request of the underlying connection this session manages.

<Aside title="Fetch-based frameworks only" type="note">
    This method is only relevant when using a framework that is based on the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).<br />
    If your framework uses the Node [HTTP/1](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html) or [HTTP/2](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http2.html) APIs you do not need to use it.
</Aside>

When using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), this will be the original `Request` object passed to the session constructor.

When using the [Node HTTP APIs](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), this will be a new `Request` object with status code and headers copied from the original request.<br />
When the originally given request or response is closed, the abort signal attached to this `Request` will be triggered.

#### `Session#getResponse`: `() => Response`

Get a [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object representing the response of the underlying connection this session manages.

<Aside title="Fetch-based frameworks only" type="note">
    This method is only relevant when using a framework that is based on the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).<br />
    If your framework uses the Node [HTTP/1](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html) or [HTTP/2](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http2.html) APIs you do not need to use it.
</Aside>

When using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), this will be a new `Response` object with status code and headers copied from the original response if given.<br />
Its body will be a [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) that should begin being consumed for the session to consider itself connected.

When using the [Node HTTP APIs](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), this will be a new `Response` object with status code and headers copied from the original response.<br />
Its body will be `null`, as data is instead written to the stream of the [originally given response object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#responsewritechunk-encoding-callback).

#### `Session#push`: `(data: unknown[, eventName: string[, eventId: string]]) => this`

Push an event to the client.

If no event name is given, the event name is set to `"message"`.

If no event ID is given, the event ID (and thus the [`lastId` property](#sessionlastid-string)) is set to a [randomly generated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID) [UUIDv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)).

If the session has disconnected, an [`SseError`](#sseerror) will be thrown.

Emits the `push` event with the given data, event name and event ID in that order.

#### `Session#stream`: `(stream: stream.Readable | ReadableStream[, options: object]) => Promise<boolean>`

Pipe readable stream data to the client.

Each data emission by the stream pushes a new event to the client.

This uses the [`push`](#sessionpush-data-unknown-eventname-string-eventid-string--this) method under the hood.

Returns a promise that resolves with `true` once the stream has been fully consumed and all data is sent to the client.

|`options.`|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`eventName`|`string`|`"stream"`|Event name to use when dispatching a data event from the stream to the client.|

#### `Session#iterate`: `(iterable: Iterable | AsyncIterable[, options: object]) => Promise<void>`

Iterate over an iterable and send yielded values to the client.

Each yield pushes a new event to the client.

This uses the [`push`](#sessionpush-data-unknown-eventname-string-eventid-string--this) method under the hood.

|`options.`|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`eventName`|`string`|`"iteration"`|Event name to use when dispatching a data event from the yielded value to the client.|

#### `Session#batch`: `(batcher: EventBuffer | ((buffer: EventBuffer) => void | Promise<void>)) => Promise<void>`

Batch and send multiple events at once.

If given an [`EventBuffer`](#eventbuffer) instance, its contents will be sent to the client.

If given a callback, it will be passed an instance of [`EventBuffer`](#eventbuffer) which uses the same serializer and sanitizer as the session.  
Once its execution completes - or once it resolves if it returns a promise - the contents of the passed [`EventBuffer`](#eventbuffer) will be sent to the client.

Returns a promise that resolves once all data from the event buffer has been successfully sent to the client.

### `createSession`: `<State>(...args: ConstructorParameters<typeof Session>) => Promise<Session<State>>`

*Overloads:*

```typescript
createSession(IncomingMessage, ServerResponse, SessionOptions?): Promise<Session>
createSession(Http2ServerRequest, Http2ServerResponse, SessionOptions?): Promise<Session>
createSession(Request, Response, SessionOptions?): Promise<Session>
createSession(Request, SessionOptions?): Promise<Session>
```

Create a new [`Session`](#sessionstate).

Takes the [same arguments as the Session class constructor](#new-sessionstate--defaultsessionstatereq-incomingmessage--http2serverrequest--request-res-serverresponse--http2serverresponse--response--sessionoptions-options-sessionoptions).

When using the Fetch API, resolves immediately with a session instance before it has connected.<br />
You can listen for the `connected` event on the session to know when it has connected, or otherwise use the shorthand `createResponse` function that does so for you instead.

When using the Node HTTP APIs, waits for the session to connect before resolving with its instance.

### `createResponse`: `<State>(...args: ConstructorParameters<typeof Session>, callback: (session: Session<State>) => void) => Response`

*Overloads:*

```typescript
createResponse(Request, CreateResponseCallback): Response
createResponse(Request, SessionOptions, CreateResponseCallback): Response
createResponse(Request, Response, CreateResponseCallback): Response
createResponse(Request, Response, SessionOptions, CreateResponseCallback): Response
```

Create a new session using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and return its corresponding `Response` object.

<Aside title="Fetch-based frameworks only" type="note">
    This helper function is only relevant when using a framework that is based on the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).<br />
    If your framework uses the Node [HTTP/1](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html) or [HTTP/2](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http2.html) APIs you do not need to use it.
</Aside>

Takes the [same arguments as the Session class constructor](#new-sessionstate--defaultsessionstatereq-incomingmessage--http2serverrequest--request-res-serverresponse--http2serverresponse--response--sessionoptions-options-sessionoptions).

The last argument should be a callback function `CreateResponseCallback` that will be invoked with the session instance once it has connected.

The following two code snippets are equivalent:

```typescript
const session = await createSession(request)

session.addListener("connected", () => {
    session.push("Hello world!")
})

return session.getResponse()
```

```typescript
return createResponse(request, (session) => {
    session.push("Hello world!")
})
```

### `Channel<State, SessionState>`

*Extends from [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)*.

A `Channel` is used to broadcast events to many sessions at once.

You may use the second generic argument `SessionState` to enforce that only sessions
with the same state type may be registered with this channel.

#### `new Channel<State = DefaultChannelState, SessionState = DefaultSessionState>([options: ChannelOptions])`

`options` is a `ChannelOptions` object with the following properties:

|Property|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`state`|`State`|`DefaultChannelState`|Initial custom state for the channel.<br /><br />Accessed via the [`state`](#channelstate-state) property.<br /><br />When using TypeScript, providing the initial state structure allows the type of the `state` property to be automatically inferred.|

#### `Channel#state`: `State`

Custom state for this channel.

Use this object to safely store information related to the channel.

You may set an initial value for this property using the `state` property in the [constructor `options` object](#new-channelstate-sessionstate), allowing its type to be automatically inferred.

Use [module augmentation and declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation) to safely add new properties to the `DefaultChannelState` interface.

#### `Channel#activeSessions`: `ReadonlyArray<Session>`

List of the currently active sessions registered with this channel.

You should not mutate the contents of this array.

#### `Channel#sessionCount`: `number`

Number of sessions registered with this channel.

Equivalent to `channel.activeSessions.length`, though slightly faster to access.

#### `Channel#register`: `(session: Session) => this`

Register a session so that it can start receiving events from this channel.

Note that a session must be [connected](#session%23isconnected%3A-boolean) before it can be registered to a channel.

Fires the `session-registered` event with the registered session as its first argument.

If the session was already registered to begin with this method does nothing.

#### `Channel#deregister`: `(session: Session) => this`

Deregister a session so that it no longer receives events from this channel.

Note that sessions are automatically deregistered when they are disconnected.

Fires the `session-deregistered` event with the session as its first argument.

If the session was disconnected the channel will also fire the `session-disconnected` event with the disconnected session as its first argument beforehand.

If the session was not registered to begin with this method does nothing.

#### `Channel#broadcast`: `(data: unknown[, eventName: string[, options: object]]) => this`

Broadcasts an event with the given data and name to every active session registered with this channel.

Under the hood this calls the [`push`](#session%23push%3A-(event%3A-string%2C-data%3A-any)-%3D>-this-%7C-(data%3A-any)-%3D>-this) method on every active session.

If no event name is given, the event name is set to `"message"`.

Emits the `broadcast` event with the given data, event name and event ID in that order.

Note that the broadcasted event will have the same ID across all receiving sessions instead of generating a unique ID for each.

|`options.`|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`eventId`|`string`||Unique ID for the event being broadcast.<br /><br />If no event ID is given, the event ID is set to a [randomly generated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID) [UUIDv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)).|
|`filter`|`(session: Session) => boolean`||Filter sessions that should receive the event.<br /><br />Called with each session and should return `true` to allow the event to be sent and otherwise return `false` to prevent the session from receiving the event.|

### `createChannel`: `<State, SessionState>(...args: ConstructorParameters<typeof Channel>) => Channel<State>`

Creates and returns an instance of a [Channel](#channelstate-sessionstate).

Takes the [same arguments as the Channel class constructor](#channelstate-sessionstate).

### `EventBuffer`

An `EventBuffer` allows you to write [raw spec-compliant SSE fields](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#processField) into a text buffer that can be sent directly over the wire.

#### `new EventBuffer([options: EventBufferOptions])`

`options` is an `EventBufferOptions` object with the following properties:

|Property|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`serializer`|`function`|`JSON.stringify`|Serialize data to a string that can be written over the wire.<br /><br />Note that only values written with [`data`](#eventbufferdata-data-unknown--this) (and implicitly [`push`](#eventbufferpush-data-unknown-eventname-string-eventid-string--this)) are serialized, as everything else is assumed to already be a string.|
|`sanitizer`|`function`||Sanitize values so as to not prematurely dispatch events when writing fields whose text inadvertently contains newlines.<br /><br />By default, CR, LF and CRLF characters are replaced with a single LF character (`\n`) and then any trailing LF characters are stripped.|

#### `EventBuffer#event`: `(type: string) => this`

Write an event name field (also referred to as the event "type" in the specification).

#### `EventBuffer#data`: `(data: unknown) => this`

Write arbitrary data into a data field.

Data is serialized to a string using the given `serializer` function option or [JSON stringification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) by default.

#### `EventBuffer#id`: `([id: string]) => this`

Write an event ID field.

Defaults to an empty string if no argument is given.

#### `EventBuffer#retry`: `(time: number) => this`

Write a retry field that suggests a reconnection time with the given milliseconds.

#### `EventBuffer#comment`: `([text: string]) => this`

Write a comment (an ignored field).

This will not fire an event but is often used to keep the connection alive.

#### `EventBuffer#dispatch`: `() => this`

Indicate that the event has finished being created by writing an additional newline character.

#### `EventBuffer#push`: `(data: unknown[, eventName: string[, eventId: string]]) => this`

Create, write and dispatch an event with the given data all at once.

This is equivalent to calling the methods `event`, `id`, `data` and `dispatch` in that order.

If no event name is given, the event name is set to `"message"`.

If no event ID is given, the event ID is set to a [randomly generated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID) [UUIDv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)).

#### `EventBuffer#stream`: `(stream: stream.Readable | ReadableStream[, options: object]) => Promise<boolean>`

Pipe readable stream data as a series of events into the buffer.

Each data emission by the stream pushes a new event.

This uses the [`push`](#eventbufferpush-data-unknown-eventname-string-eventid-string--this) method under the hood.

Returns a promise that resolves with `true` once the stream has been fully consumed.

|`options.`|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`eventName`|`string`|`"stream"`|Event name to use for each event created.|

#### `EventBuffer#iterate`: `(iterable: Iterable | AsyncIterable[, options: object]) => Promise<void>`

Iterate over an iterable and write yielded values as events into the buffer.

This uses the [`push`](#eventbufferpush-data-unknown-eventname-string-eventid-string--this) method under the hood.

|`options.`|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`eventName`|`string`|`"iteration"`|Event name to use for each event created.|

#### `EventBuffer#clear`: `() => this`

Clear the contents of the buffer.

#### `EventBuffer#read`: `() => string`

Get a copy of the buffer contents.

### `createEventBuffer`: `(...args: ConstructorParameters<typeof EventBuffer>) => EventBuffer`

Creates and returns an instance of an [EventBuffer](#eventbuffer).

Takes the [same arguments as the EventBuffer class constructor](#new-eventbufferoptions-).

### `SseError`

*Extends from [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)*.

Represents an SSE-related error thrown from within Better SSE.

### `Connection`

*Abstract class.*

A `Connection` represents the underlying connection that a [`Session`](#sessionstate) manages, abstracting away the differences between the [Node HTTP/1](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html), [Node HTTP/2](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http2.html), [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and any other APIs.

You can implement your own custom `Connection` subclass to make Better SSE compatible with any framework.

#### `Connection#url`: `URL`

*Abstract property.*

The URL used to open the connection to the server.

For [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)-based connections, [this is typically constructed](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_url) from the request [`Host` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Host) and URL path, including the [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string).

#### `Connection#request`: `Request`

*Abstract property.*

A [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object representing the request that opened the connection.

You should populate its [`url`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/url) property - likely with the same value as the [`url` property](#connectionurl) - its [`method`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/method) and its [`headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/headers) properties.

You should populate its [`signal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/signal) property with an [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) that gets triggered when the request *or* the response is closed, indicating to the session that the connection has disconnected.

#### `Connection#response`: `Response`

*Abstract property.*

A [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object representing the response that will be sent to the client.

You should populate its [`status`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/status) and [`headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/headers) properties.

You *may* populate its [`body`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/body) property with a [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) that will [enqueue](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamDefaultController/enqueue) any data written with the [`sendChunk`](#connectionsendchunk-chunk-string--void) method if you intend to use the session with a [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)-based framework.

#### `Connection#sendHead`: `() => void`

*Abstract method.*

Send the response head with status code and headers from the [`response`](#connectionresponse-response) instance.

#### `Connection#sendChunk`: `(chunk: string) => void`

*Abstract method.*

Write a chunk of data to the socket.

You should [encode the data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder) to UTF-8 beforehand.

#### `Connection#cleanup`: `() => void`

*Abstract method.*

Perform any necessary cleanup after the connection is closed.

### `NodeHttp1Connection`

*Extends from [Connection](#connection).*

The in-built `NodeHttp1Connection` represents a connection based on the Node [HTTP/1 API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html).

#### `new NodeHttp1Connection(req: IncomingMessage, res: ServerResponse[, options: ConnectionOptions])`

`req` is an instance of [IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage).

`res` is an instance of [ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse).

<ConnectionOptions />

### `NodeHttp2CompatConnection`

*Extends from [Connection](#connection).*

The in-built `NodeHttp2CompatConnection` represents a connection based on the Node [HTTP/2 Compatibility API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http2.html#compatibility-api).

#### `new NodeHttp2CompatConnection(req: Http2ServerRequest, res: Http2ServerResponse[, options: ConnectionOptions])`

`req` is an instance of [Http2ServerRequest](https://nodejs.org/api/http2.html#class-http2http2serverrequest).

`res` is an instance of [Http2ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http2.html#class-http2http2serverresponse).

<ConnectionOptions />

### `FetchConnection`

*Extends from [Connection](#connection).*

The in-built `FetchConnection` represents a connection based on the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

#### `new FetchConnection(req: Request[, res: Response][, options: ConnectionOptions])`

`req` is an instance of [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request).

`res` is an instance of [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response), if given.

<ConnectionOptions />
