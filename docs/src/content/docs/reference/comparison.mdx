This section compares Better SSE with other server-sent events libraries for Node.

Better SSE was designed to be the easiest and most powerful library for using server-sent events, better than all other existing solutions.

## Features

<Aside title="TL/DR" type="tip">
    Better SSE supports all\* the features that other competing libraries do and much more. It is TypeScript-first (but obviously can be used with JavaScript), very well tested, easier to scale and much more flexible than others whilst *still* having a simpler programming interface for both simple and complex use cases.
